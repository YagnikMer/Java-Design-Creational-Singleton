# Java-Design-Creational-Singleton

SingleTon Design Pattern

DEFINATION:

define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it


HOW TO CREATE

Static member: 
It gets memory only once because of static, it contains the instance of the Singleton class.

Private constructor:
It will prevent to instantiate the Singleton class from outside the class.

Static factory method: 
This provides the global point of access to the Singleton object and returns the instance to the caller.
